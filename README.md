# Protesto Platformu

Hi! This is my first web3 protest platform project. I am learning React and web development. This app is for people who want to join or make protest and boycott. It is safe and easy (I hope!).

## How to start?

1. You need Node.js and npm (I use latest version, maybe old works too)
2. Download this project (git clone or download zip)
3. Open terminal and write:

```
npm install
```

4. Then start app:

```
npm start
```

5. Open browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## What is inside?

- React (for frontend)
- Firebase (for login)
- Tailwind CSS (for style)
- Two language: Turkish and English

## Why I made this?

I want to help people organize protest and boycott. Also, I want to learn coding and github. Sorry if code is not perfect!

## Can I help?

Yes! Please send pull request or issue. I am happy to learn from you.
